  <div class="founder-content">
    <p class="fade-in">Robert Bromford Ward II didn't grow up in luxury. He grew up around it — close enough to study it, far enough to see through it. While other brands whisper, Ward speaks clearly. While they understate, he punctuates.</p>

    <p class="fade-in">Rich as Piss is the product of a lifetime spent observing what wealth actually looks like behind closed doors: the irreverence, the humor, the refusal to take oneself too seriously while taking one's craft with absolute seriousness.</p>

    <blockquote class="fade-in">"I wanted to build something that felt like the conversation rich people actually have. Not the curated, polished, boring version. The real one. The one where someone pours you a glass of something expensive and says something that makes you laugh until you cry."</blockquote>

    <p class="fade-in">Every product in the collection reflects this philosophy. Premium materials. Impeccable construction. A name that stops you in your tracks.</p>

    <p class="fade-in">Because anyone can make luxury goods. It takes something else entirely to make luxury goods that make you smile.</p>

    <h2 class="section-heading fade-in" style="margin-top:4rem;">Design Philosophy</h2>

    <p class="fade-in">Ward oversees every detail — from material selection to packaging to the weight of each product in your hand. He believes luxury should engage all the senses, including your sense of humor.</p>

    <blockquote class="fade-in">"If you're spending $275 on a paperweight, it should be the most beautiful paperweight you've ever seen. And it should have a name that makes your accountant do a double-take."</blockquote>

    <p class="fade-in">The "RAP" crest — a crown over crossed keys, flanked by lions — represents access and audacity. The keys open doors. The crown is self-explanatory. The lions are just showing off.</p>
