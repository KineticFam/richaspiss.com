  <div class="founder-content">
    <p class="fade-in"><strong>Bromford Ward III</strong> is an entrepreneur, lifestyle tastemaker, and self-proclaimed connoisseur of the finer things in life. Born into comfort and raised on platinum expectations, Robert spent his formative decades mastering the art of effortless luxury — a standard made possible by generous access to his father's credit card, a privilege that famously extended well into his mid-thirties.</p>

    <p class="fade-in">During those gilded years, Robert cultivated a refined appreciation for five-star hotels, tailored wardrobes, premium spirits, and the subtle difference between "expensive" and "exceptional." While others were budgeting, Robert was benchmarking bottle service. While peers were climbing ladders, he was selecting yachts.</p>

    <p class="fade-in">At 35, when the card finally retired, Robert experienced what he calls his "renaissance of responsibility." Rather than retreat from the spotlight of indulgence, he transformed his lived expertise into a brand.</p>

    <blockquote class="fade-in">"Live large, tip well, and never apologize for premium taste."</blockquote>

    <p class="fade-in">Today, Robert is the founder of a lifestyle product line inspired by the unapologetic abundance that defined his early adulthood. From opulent home goods to statement accessories, each piece reflects his philosophy: live large, tip well, and never apologize for premium taste.</p>

    <p class="fade-in">Equal parts legend and lesson, Bromford Ward III now channels his storied past into a celebration of aspirational living — because while credit limits may change, standards never should.</p>
