        <p>Every luxury brand has a story about heritage, tradition, and restraint. This isn't that story.</p>
        <p>Rich as Piss was born from a simple truth: the best things in life aren't quiet. They're bold. They're unapologetic. They're a little bit ridiculous — and entirely intentional.</p>
        <p>We source the finest materials. We work with artisans who take their craft as seriously as we take ours. And we put a name on it that you'll never forget.</p>
        <p>Because if you can't laugh at yourself while wearing a $385 robe, what's the point of having money?</p>
